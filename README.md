A Tbook consists of one folder (archived or not)
  that holds sequential MD or TXT text files.
The folder represents a book
  and each file represents a section in the book.
The file names control the section order.
The folder may also contain an optional metadata file.
Books with nested structures may use sub folders for hierarchy.
