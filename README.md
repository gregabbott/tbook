Visit [the Tbook site](https://tbook.pages.dev/) to convert EPUBs to TBooks.

A Tbook consists of a zipped or unzipped folder
  that holds sequential MD or TXT text files.
The folder represents a book
  and each file represents a section in the book.
The file names control the section order.
The folder may also contain an optional metadata file.
